# Google-Contacts-Updates-Scripts
This Google Script emails all*** the people in in your Contacts / Address book and ask them to update their info.

This is a fork of  http://www.labnol.org/internet/google-contacts-updated/27306/.  I took Amit's code and updated the API calls and added more debug info. 

*** Google just put in a limit on how many you can email.  The latest numbet is 100.
